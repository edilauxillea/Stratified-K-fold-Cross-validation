# Stratified-K-fold-Cross-validation

# Overview
This repository provides an implementation of stratified k-fold cross-validation for a cancer dataset. Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a widely used technique for evaluating machine learning models when dealing with imbalanced datasets. This approach ensures that each fold of the dataset maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset, which helps to mitigate bias and improve model performance.

# Dataset
The cancer dataset used in this implementation contains a collection of samples labeled as either cancerous or non-cancerous. The dataset is assumed to be in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature or the target label. Please ensure that your dataset adheres to this format before using it with the provided code.

# Requirements
To run the code, you need the following dependencies:
  - Python (version 3.6 or higher)
  - scikit-learn library (version 0.24.2 or higher)
  - pandas library (version 1.2.4 or higher)
  - numpy library (version 1.20.2 or higher)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

# Usage
To use the stratified k-fold cross-validation for your cancer dataset, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/edilauxillea/stratified-k-fold-cross-validation.git
```
2. Place your cancer dataset in the same directory as the provided code file.
3. Open the code file Stratified-K-Fold Cross Validation in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
4. Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab on your local machine.
5. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, specifically the stratified-k-fold-cv-cancer-dataset folder.
6. Open the Cross_Validation.ipynb file within Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
7. Read through the notebook and make any necessary modifications, such as updating the file path to your cancer dataset.
8. Execute each code cell sequentially by either clicking on the "Run" button or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter. This will run the code in each cell and produce the corresponding output.
9. After executing the final code cell, the program will output the performance metrics for each fold and calculate the average metrics across all folds.

The program will execute the stratified k-fold cross-validation and display the evaluation results, including the average performance metrics across all folds.

# Results
The program will output the performance metrics for each fold and calculate the average metrics across all folds. These metrics may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and any other relevant evaluation measures depending on your dataset and model.
